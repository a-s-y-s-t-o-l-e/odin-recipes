# odin-recipes
recipe website for The Odin Project
odin-recipes will be my first project using html. I have a basic understanding of html and feel confident in my ability to make a functioning recipe website. I am not content with it looking basic. I understand html is basic, I will make my recipes website as visually pleasing and user friendly as possible using only html. 

Update: After completing my project I realized I was a little ambitious going in. I spent hours looking for ways to customize HTML to make my site look better. After realize I must wait until I have a better understanding of CSS and JAVA the project flew by and was extremely fun. I enjoyed working from my memory and the skills I've built the past few days.
